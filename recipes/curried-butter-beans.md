# Curried Butter Beans

A rich and creamy vegan curried butter beans recipe. Perfect for a week night meal or meal prepping for lunch.

## Instructions

1. Start by finely chopping the shallots, then add to a large pan with the coconut oil and start to fry, chop the garlic and add to the pan, followed by the ginger.
2. After 5 minutes add the tomato puree with a splash of water to loosen, add the curry powder and butter beans (including the water from the tin) and toss until coated.
3. Pour in the coconut cream (the tinned stuff) then season with salt and allow to bubble away for a few minutes to heat the beans.
4. Pour in the chopped spinach, add the lime juice, chilli flakes and any extra seasoning it may need.
5. Serve with rice, or on crunchy sourdough.
