# Chicken/Turkey Sesame Noodles



## Instructions

1. First make the sauce. Whisk together all ingredients until smooth, adding 1-2 tablespoons water to help smooth it out as you whisk.
2. Boil a pot of water and cook the noodles according to package instructions. Drain and do not rinse.
3. Heat the sesame oil a large deep skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the shrimp (or chicken/turkey per preference) in one even layer and cook for about 2 minutes each side until cooked through. Set aside.
4. In the same pan, add the bell pepper and stir occasionally until soft, 3-5 minutes. Add the cooked protein, sauce, and cooked noodles in the pan and toss to coat in sauce. Serve with green onion, chopped peanuts and chili onion crunch to top!
