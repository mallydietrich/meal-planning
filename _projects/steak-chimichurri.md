# Steak Chimichurri Dense Bean Salad


## Instructions

1. Generously season the steak with sea salt and cracked black pepper. Let the salt soak in for at least 15 minutes but up to an hour. Preheat your grill to high and cook your steak till seared on each side (about 3 minutes).
2. Pull your steak off and let it rest while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
3. Finely mince the shallots, parsley, and cilantro.
4. Rinse and drain the beans and mozzarella balls, if the mozzarella balls are bigger, cut them in half.
5. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half and chop the roasted red peppers.
6. Add the shallots, parsley, cilantro, beans, mozzarella, tomatoes, and roasted red peppers.
7. Chop the steak into bite-size pieces and add to the bowl.
8. You can mix the dressing up separately, but since it goes together anyway, I just add it all to the bowl so I don't have to do as many dishes.
9. Add the garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, red pepper flakes, sea salt, and juice of the lemon to the salad.
10. Toss the salad together until the herbs coat everything.
11. Store in Tupperware in the fridge for up to four days or eat immediately.
